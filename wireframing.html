<body>
    <p>Wireframing is one of the most important steps in the design and development process of a website or application.
        It helps you visualize the structure and layout of your interface before any actual design or coding begins.
    </p>
    <h2>✅ What is Wireframing?</h2>
    <p>Wireframing is the process of creating a low-fidelity layout of a digital product. It shows the skeleton of the
        page — focusing on content placement, navigation, and user interactions without distractions like color, fonts,
        or images.

        Think of it like the blueprint of a house before construction.
